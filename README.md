**Reveal less. Engage more.**

SoftReveal is a web-based tool for controlling the pace of information disclosure, designed for screen recording and visual storytelling. It's not just an "image blurring" app—it's a presentation tool that helps you maintain audience engagement by revealing content at the right moment.
